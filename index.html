     I want you to know that you mean as much to me as well, buddy. Best birthday.

    Now I understand why they say that dogs are a man’s best friend. You can sense it when something is bothering me and
    cuddle up beside me to comfort me. Thank you, buddy. I couldn’t imagine a world without you. Wonderful birthday.

    You are more than just a pet – you are my jogging buddy, my alarm clock, my best friend,
    my furniture destroyer, and my furry pillow. The moment you walked into my life, everything has changed
    . Although my apartment has been messier, I have never been more happier in my life. Thank you, buddy.
    Happy bday.</p></strong>
